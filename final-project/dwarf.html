        <h2>Dwarfs</h2>
        <p>
            A dwarf planet is a small planetary-mass object that is in direct orbit around the Sun, 
            massive enough to be gravitationally rounded, but insufficient to achieve orbital dominance like the eight classical planets of the Solar System. 
            The prototypical dwarf planet is Pluto, which for decades was regarded as a planet before the "dwarf" concept was adopted in 2006.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The interest of dwarf planets to planetary geologists is that they may be geologically active bodies, 
            an expectation that was borne out in 2015 by the Dawn mission to Ceres and the New Horizons mission to Pluto. 
            Astronomers are in general agreement that at least the eight largest candidates are dwarf planets : 
            in rough order of size, Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, Gonggong, Quaoar, Sedna and Ceres. 
            Considering the ten largest candidates adds Orcus and Salacia; of these ten, 
            two have been visited by spacecraft (Pluto and Ceres) and seven others have at least one known moon 
            (Eris, Haumea, Makemake, Gonggong, Quaoar, Orcus, and Salacia), which allows their masses and thus an estimate of their densities to be determined. 
            Mass and density in turn can be fit into geophysical models in an attempt to determine the nature of these worlds. 
            Only one, Sedna, has neither been visited nor has any known moons, making an accurate estimate of mass difficult. 
            Some astronomers include many smaller bodies as well, but there is no consensus that these are likely to be dwarf planets.

            <h3>Pluto</h3>
            <h4>Dwarf One</h4>
            <p>Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, 
                a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. 
                It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a small margin, but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, 
                Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Pluto has roughly one-sixth the mass of Earth's moon, 
                and one-third its volume.

            <h3>Eris</h3>
            <h4>Dwarf Two</h4>
            <p>Eris (minor-planet designation: 136199 Eris) is the most massive and second-largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System. 
                It is a trans-Neptunian object (TNO) in the scattered disk and has a high-eccentricity orbit. 
                Eris was discovered in January 2005 by a Palomar Observatory–based team led by Mike Brown and verified later that year. 
                In September 2006, it was named after the Greco–Roman goddess of strife and discord. 
                Eris is the ninth-most massive known object orbiting the Sun and the sixteenth-most massive overall in the Solar System (counting moons). 
                It is also the largest known object in the solar system that has not been visited by a spacecraft. 
                Eris has been measured at 2,326 ± 12 kilometers (1,445 ± 7 mi) in diameter; 
                its mass is 0.28% that of the Earth and 27% greater than that of Pluto, 
                although Pluto is slightly larger by volume.[25] Both Eris and Pluto have a surface area that is comparable to the area of Russia or South America.

            <h3>Haumea</h3>
            <h4>Dwarf Three</h4>
            <p>Haumea (minor-planet designation: 136108 Haumea) is a dwarf planet located beyond Neptune's orbit. 
                It was discovered in 2004 by a team headed by Mike Brown of Caltech at the Palomar Observatory, 
                and formally announced in 2005 by a team headed by José Luis Ortiz Moreno at the Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain, 
                who had discovered it that year in precovery images taken by the team in 2003. From that announcement, 
                it received the provisional designation 2003 EL61. On September 17, 2008, it was named after Haumea, 
                the Hawaiian goddess of childbirth, under the expectation by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) that it would prove to be a dwarf planet. 
                Nominal estimates make it the third-largest known trans-Neptunian object, after Eris and Pluto, and approximately the size of Uranus's moon Titania. 
                Precovery images of Haumea have been identified back to March 22, 1955.

            <h4>Dwarf Four</h4>
            <p>Makemake[e] (minor-planet designation: 136472 Makemake) 
                is a dwarf planet and the second-largest of what is known as the classical population of Kuiper belt objects, 
                with a diameter approximately that of Saturn's moon Iapetus, or 60% that of Pluto. 
                It has one known satellite. Its extremely low average temperature, about 40 K (−230 °C), 
                means its surface is covered with methane, ethane, and possibly nitrogen ices. 
                Makemake shows signs of geothermal activity and thus may be capable of supporting active geology and harboring an active subsurface ocean.

            <h4>Dwarf Five</h4>
            <p>Gonggong (minor-planet designation: 225088 Gonggong) is a dwarf planet and a member of the scattered disc beyond Neptune. 
                It has a highly eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 34–101 astronomical units (5.1–15.1 billion kilometers; 3.2–9.4 billion miles) 
                from the Sun. As of 2019, its distance from the Sun is 88 AU (13.2×109 km; 8.2×109 mi), 
                and it is the sixth-farthest known Solar System object. According to the Deep Ecliptic Survey, 
                Gonggong is in a 3:10 orbital resonance with Neptune, in which it completes three orbits around the Sun for every ten orbits completed by Neptune. 
                Gonggong was discovered in July 2007 by American astronomers Megan Schwamb, Michael Brown, and David Rabinowitz at the Palomar Observatory, 
                and the discovery was announced in January 2009.

            <h4>Dwarf Six</h4>
            <p>Quaoar (minor-planet designation: 50000 Quaoar) is a large, 
                ringed trans-Neptunian object in the Kuiper belt, a region of icy planetesimals beyond Neptune. 
                It has an elongated ellipsoid shape with an average diameter of 1,090 km (680 mi), 
                about half the size of the dwarf planet Pluto. 
                The object was discovered by American astronomers Chad Trujillo and Michael Brown at the Palomar Observatory on 4 June 2002. 
                Quaoar's surface contains crystalline water ice and ammonia hydrate, which suggests that it might have experienced cryovolcanism. 
                A small amount of methane is present on its surface, which can only be retained by the largest Kuiper belt objects.

            <h3>Sedna</h3>
            <h4>Dwarf Seven</h4>
            <p>Sedna (minor-planet designation: 90377 Sedna) is a dwarf planet in the outermost reaches of the Solar System, 
                orbiting the Sun beyond the orbit of Neptune. Discovered in 2003, 
                the planetoid's surface is one of the reddest known among Solar System bodies. 
                Spectroscopy has revealed Sedna's surface to be mostly a mixture of the solid ices of water, methane, and nitrogen, 
                along with widespread deposits of reddish-colored tholins, a chemical makeup similar to those of some other trans-Neptunian objects. 
                Within the range of uncertainties, it is tied with the dwarf planet Ceres in the asteroid belt as the largest dwarf planet not known to have a moon. 
                Its diameter is roughly 1,000 km (most likely in between those of Ceres and Saturn's moon Tethys). Owing to its lack of known moons, 
                the Keplerian laws of planetary motion cannot be employed for determining its mass, and the precise figure as yet remains unknown.

                It was the first known asteroid, discovered on 1 January 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi at Palermo Astronomical Observatory in Sicily, 
                and announced as a new planet. Ceres was later classified as an asteroid and then a dwarf planet, the only one inside Neptune's orbit.
