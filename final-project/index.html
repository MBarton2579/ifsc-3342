            <p>There are eight planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</p>

        <h2>The Solar System</h2>
        <p>
            The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. 
            It was formed 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc. 
            The Sun is an ordinary main sequence star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core, 
            releasing this energy from its outer photosphere.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The largest objects that orbit the Sun are the eight planets. 
            In order from the Sun, they are four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); 
            two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn); and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). 
            All terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. Inversely, all giant planets do not have a definite surface, as they are mainly composed of gases and liquids. 
            Over 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and nearly 90% of the remaining mass is in Jupiter and Saturn.

                Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.

            <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. 
                As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.

            <h4>The Third Planet</h4>
            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. 
                While large amounts of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. 
                About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers.

                In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often called the \"Red Planet\".

                It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, 
                but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.

            <h4>The Sixth Planet</h4>
            <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. 
                It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. 
                It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.

            <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. 
                Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, 
                was the great-grandfather of Ares, grandfather of Zeus and father of Cronus. 
                It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.

            <h4>The Eighth Planet</h4>
            <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. 
                In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. 
                It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.
